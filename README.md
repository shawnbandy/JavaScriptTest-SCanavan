Goals of the Assignment:
1. Make a Code Quiz with a start button
2. Start button starts the test. Test consists of questions to answer with a timer ticking downwards
3. Whenever a question is answered, a new question shows up on screen 
4. Whenever a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the overall timer
5. When all the questions have been answered, or if the timer hits 0, the game is over

3. Questions are given to the user, and when answered, a new question is displayed 
4. When an incorrect answer is selected, time is subtracted and "incorrect" is displayed" 
5. Game over screen occurs when everything is answered or timer hits 0
6. User is prompted to enter their initials when they make a high score
